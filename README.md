# Ecommerce Data Ingestion and Analysis using MySQL and Python

This project demonstrates how to efficiently load CSV files into a MySQL database, process the data, and perform various SQL queries for ecommerce analysis. The data consists of customer details, order information, product listings, and other key tables, which are analyzed using Python libraries like Pandas and MySQL Connector.

## Project Structure

- **customers.csv**: Customer data
- **order_items.csv**: Data about items in customer orders
- **sellers.csv**: Seller information
- **products.csv**: Product catalog
- **geolocation.csv**: Geographic data of customers
- **payments.csv**: Payment details for each order
- **orders.csv**: Order metadata

## Features

- Load CSV files into a MySQL database with dynamic table creation based on column types.
- Perform various queries on the database, including customer insights, sales trends, and retention rates.
- Generate visualizations from SQL results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- MySQL server and client
- Libraries: Pandas, MySQL Connector, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-data-analysis.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas mysql-connector-python matplotlib seaborn
```

3. Set up MySQL and create a database named `ecommerce`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;
```

4. Update the database connection credentials in the Python script.

## Data Ingestion

The provided Python script dynamically ingests multiple CSV files and loads them into corresponding tables in a MySQL database.

- The `get_sql_type` function dynamically assigns SQL types (INT, FLOAT, TEXT, etc.) based on the Pandas dataframe's column types.
- Before inserting data, the script cleans column names and replaces `NaN` values with `NULL`.

```python
# Example CSV file ingestion process
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
df = df.where(pd.notnull(df), None)
# Table creation and data insertion in MySQL
cursor.execute(create_table_query)
cursor.execute(insert_query)
```

## Queries

Below are the queries used to extract insights from the ecommerce dataset.

### Basic Queries

    JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
    GROUP BY p.product_category
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 10;
